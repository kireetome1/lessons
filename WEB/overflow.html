<h1>overflow</h1>

<div>Description
Overflow options include clipping, showing scrollbars, or displaying the content flowing out of its container into the surrounding area.

Specifying a value other than visible (the default) creates a new block formatting context. This is necessary for technical reasons â€” if a float intersected with the scrolling element it would forcibly rewrap the content after each scroll step, leading to a slow scrolling experience.

In order for overflow to have an effect, the block-level container must have either a set height (height or max-height) or white-space set to nowrap.

Setting one axis to visible (the default) while setting the other to a different value results in visible behaving as auto.

The JavaScript Element.scrollTop property may be used to scroll an HTML element even when overflow is set to hidden.</div>
